# ✨ Welcome to My GitHub Garden 🌿

Born under the Mediterranean sun in **Tripoli, Libya**, now building in the digital clouds of **London, UK**.  
I explore the magical intersection of **data, cloud infrastructure, and human-centered technology** — always asking:  
_What if tech didn’t just solve problems, but told stories, healed ecosystems, and empowered minds?_
